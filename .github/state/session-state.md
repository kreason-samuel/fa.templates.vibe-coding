## Decision Context

**Key Architectural Decisions**:

- Moved AI state files to .github/state/ for better GitHub integration and discoverability
- Updated all framework references to maintain consistency
- Established gaia-changes.md for improvement tracking

**Technology Selections**:

- Maintained markdown-based documentation approach
- Used shell commands for file operations
- Leveraged GitHub's native directory conventions

**Design Changes**:

- Reorganized AI workflow files for better structure
- Enhanced template organization without breaking functionality

**Security Implementations**: N/A (Documentation-focused framework)

## Quality Gates Status

**Code Quality**: [Linting %, warnings count, type safety %]
**Test Coverage**: [Unit %, Integration %, E2E %]
**Security Scan**: [SAST/DAST results, vulnerabilities]
**Performance**: [Build times, bundle size, load times]

## Recovery Commands (For Context Loss)

**MANDATORY SEQUENCE** - Execute in this exact order:

1. `read_file ./.github/state/plan.md` - **FIRST PRIORITY** - Full project plan
2. `read_file ./.docs/designs/1-use-cases.md` - **SECOND PRIORITY** - All use cases for tracking
3. `read_file ./.github/state/session-state.md` - Current session state (this file)
4. `read_file ./.docs/designs/*.md` - Design documents status
5. `list_dir src/` - Implementation status
6. `get_errors ["src/"]` - Current issues

**Plan & Use Case Sync Command**: Always run after context recovery:

```
[PLAN-SYNC] Read ./.github/state/plan.md and ./.docs/designs/1-use-cases.md, cross-reference with current session state, validate milestone progress and use case completion, and update this session-state.md with accurate tracking information.
```

## Context Validation Checklist

**Plan Synchronization** (MANDATORY):

- [ ] ./.github/state/plan.md has been read and reviewed in this session
- [ ] Current milestone matches plan.md milestone definitions
- [ ] Progress percentage aligns with plan timeline
- [ ] Any deviations from plan are documented with rationale
- [ ] Upcoming milestones are correctly identified from plan

**Session State Accuracy**:

- [ ] Current milestone clearly identified
- [ ] Next 3 actions are specific and actionable
- [ ] All architectural decisions are documented
- [ ] Design document status is accurate
- [ ] Build and test status is current
- [ ] Visual design direction is established
- [ ] No critical context is missing

**Plan Adherence Validation**:

- [ ] Implementation follows planned architecture
- [ ] Technology stack matches plan specifications
- [ ] Timeline is realistic based on plan milestones
- [ ] Quality gates align with plan requirements

**Use Case Tracking Validation** (MANDATORY):

- [ ] All use cases from ./.docs/designs/1-use-cases.md are identified and listed
- [ ] Each use case has clear status tracking (Not Started/In Progress/Completed/Tested)
- [ ] Implementation coverage is specified for each use case (Frontend/Backend/Both)
- [ ] Test coverage is documented for each use case (Unit/Integration/E2E)
- [ ] Critical path use cases are identified and prioritized
- [ ] Blocked use cases have documented blockers and mitigation plans
- [ ] Use case completion percentage is mathematically accurate
- [ ] No use cases are missing from the original design documentation

## Framework Intelligence Markers

**Pattern Matching**: [Which example pattern is being followed]
**Smart Defaults Applied**: [List of automatic decisions made]
**Framework Compliance**: [Adherence to structure, quality, security standards]
**Documentation Reference**: [Which framework docs were consulted recently]

## 🔄 Plan Synchronization Protocol

### When to Sync with Plan

**MANDATORY Sync Triggers**:

- **🔍 EVERY TIME** you read this session-state.md file (ALWAYS read plan.md first)
- **🔍 EVERY TIME** you update this session-state.md file (ALWAYS read plan.md first)
- At the start of every session (context recovery)
- Before beginning any new milestone
- When encountering blockers or scope changes
- Every 3-5 actions (as mentioned in init.md reminder prompts)
- When session state shows >20% progress change
- Before finalizing any major architectural decisions

**NON-NEGOTIABLE RULE**: Never process session state without first reading the plan file.

### How to Perform Plan Sync

**MANDATORY SEQUENCE** (Never deviate from this order):

1. **🔍 READ PLAN FIRST**: `read_file('./.github/state/plan.md')` - **THIS IS STEP #1 ALWAYS**
2. **Compare Status**: Match current progress against plan milestones
3. **Identify Gaps**: Note any missing or incomplete items from plan
4. **Update Tracking**: Mark completed items, update progress percentages
5. **Document Changes**: Record any deviations or scope adjustments
6. **Validate Next Steps**: Ensure next actions align with plan priorities
7. **🚀 IMMEDIATELY CONTINUE**: Never stop after sync - proceed to next task automatically

**CRITICAL REMINDER**: Step 1 is non-negotiable. You cannot properly process session state without understanding the plan context.

### Plan Sync Quality Checklist

- [ ] **🔍 PLAN READ FIRST**: Plan has been read using `read_file` tool BEFORE processing session state
- [ ] Plan has been read in current session
- [ ] Milestone status accurately reflects plan
- [ ] Progress tracking is mathematically consistent
- [ ] Next actions are derived from plan priorities
- [ ] Any plan deviations are justified and documented
- [ ] Timeline adjustments are realistic and explained
- [ ] **🚀 Automatic continuation**: Ready to proceed without user confirmation

**Remember**: The plan is the source of truth. Session state should reflect plan reality, not replace it. **ALWAYS READ PLAN FIRST, THEN CONTINUE AUTOMATICALLY AFTER SYNC**.

## 🚨 **CRITICAL REMINDER**

**BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING WITH THIS SESSION STATE FILE**:

1. **🔍 READ THE PLAN**: `read_file('./.github/state/plan.md')`
2. **UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT**: Know what the project is trying to achieve
3. **THEN PROCESS**: Update session state based on plan reality
4. **🚀 CONTINUE AUTOMATICALLY**: Never stop after reading/updating

**This is not optional. This is not a suggestion. This is a MANDATORY requirement for proper AI operation.**
